# [Problem Statement] - Damage System

**Create Damage System for player and enemy tank using Interfaces**

For example -

Implement a system where the player tank can take and give some amount of damage as soon as the bullet hits the enemy tank. The damage should also reflect on the overall health bar of the player. 

Just like this implement damage taken and given by different enemies to your player tank.
