# [Problem Statement] - Damage System

**Create Damage System for player and enemy tank using Interfaces**

For example -

Implement a system where the player tank can take and give some amount of damage as soon as the bullet hits the enemy tank. The damage should also reflect on the overall health of the player tank. 

Just like this implement,

- Damage taken by the enemy tank
- Damage given by the enemy tank
