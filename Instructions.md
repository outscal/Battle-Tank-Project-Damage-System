# Instructions for going through the Problem Statement

You can find a working Battle Tank project repository which contains the scripts and assets which you can fork in your local system and refer to the implementations done in Unity. Below are the features of the game that you wil be able to access from this repository.

### **Pre-Requisites**

1. Tank Movement (WSAD keys) -> Player Tank can move around the scene in the game using keyboard input
